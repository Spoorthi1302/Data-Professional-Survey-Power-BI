# Data-Professional-Survey-Power-BI
I created visuals based on a survey conducted among over 630 professionals worldwide. The dataset contained missing data (null values) and errors, which required cleaning and transformation. I utilized DAX functions to calculate the necessary columns. The cleaned and transformed data was then used to build a dynamic dashboard, featuring bar graphs, donut charts, KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and other engaging visuals that provided valuable insights.

From the visuals, I observed that females were earning more than their male counterparts. Additionally, I concluded how many people were satisfied with their salary and work/life balance. Python emerged as the favorite programming language among most respondents, and data analysts were found to be the highest earners among the surveyed professions.
